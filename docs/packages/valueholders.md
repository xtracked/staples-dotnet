# ValueHolders

Xtracked.Staples.ValueHolders is a library that offers `ValueHolder`: Data class to differentiate between undefined,
null and non-null values. This is similar to [Java's Optional](
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html){: target="_blank" }, but `Optional` can only contain
a non-null value and we consider `null` to be a valid value.
